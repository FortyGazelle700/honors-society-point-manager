## üöÄ How to Get Started?

1. Fork (or clone) this Git Repository
2. Sign in (or sign up) for Netlify
3. Add a new project to Netlify
4. Sign in with your Github Account, and deploy this project
   - When prompted to add environment variables, copy the [.env.example](.env.example) file and replacing instances of `<sql_lite_url>` and `<s3_access_key_id>` with your own values.
   - If using a platform (such as Netlify), you may need to copy `POINT_TYPES` into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_POINT_TYPES` enviornment variable (instead of using the shorthand `$POINT_TYPES`). Some platforms (such as self-hosting) allow you to use the variables like in the `.env.example`.
5. Deploy!
   - Recommend adding a domain, as some schools block the `netlify.app` domain
